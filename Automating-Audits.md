# Automating Cybersecurity Auditing

## Introduction

According to Wikipedia, Cybersec Auditing refers to:
"An information security audit is an audit of the level of information security in an organization. It is an independent review and examination of system records, activities, and related documents. These audits are intended to improve the level of information security, avoid improper information security designs, and optimize the efficiency of the security safeguards and security processes."

In simple words, cybersecurity auditing is the process of systematically reviewing an organization’s security measures, configurations, and protocols to identify vulnerabilities. This ensures that the organization is effectively protecting its systems and data from potential threats.

Automating this process can help in streamlining the audit, reducing human errors, enabling real-time monitoring, and providing faster insights.

## Auditing Steps & How we can automate them

The steps involved in the cybersecurity auditing process are as follows:

1. **Planning**: This involves defining the scope of the audit, setting objectives, and determining the resources required.

    **How we can automate it**: While the planning phase requires human intervention, we can setup a system which will periodically run the checks, or run on each commit to the codebase. This will ensure that the audit is conducted at regular intervals.

2. **Data Collection**: This involves collecting data on the organization’s security measures, configurations, and protocols.

    **How we can automate it**: We can use tools like Nmap to scan the network, as well as check the configuration files for the servers (like Apache, Nginx, etc.). This data can be collected automatically by setting up scripts to run at regular intervals, and uploaded to a central server.

    We can also log the network traffic, and analyze it to identify any suspicious activities.

3. **Coding Practices**: This involves reviewing the organization’s coding practices to identify vulnerabilities.

    **How we can automate it**: We should step up a CI/CD pipeline to test the code, to ensure any new code that is pushed to the repository is secure, and works as expected.

    Also, strong typing and linting can be enforced to ensure bugs are caught early in the development process.

With some of these steps, we can supplement the manual auditing process with automated checks to fasten the process.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for automating cybersecurity auditing are as follows:

1. **Storage**: A centralized storage system to store the data collected during the audit.
2. **Role-based Access Control**: To ensure that only authorized personnel can access the audit data.
3. **Monitoring Tools**: Tools to monitor the network traffic, system logs, and other data sources.
4. **Large Language Models**: Can help in identifying vulnerabilities in the codebase.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: To automate the testing of the codebase.
